2. Background

My wife is a language teacher who uses a lot of memory games in her classroom and encouraged me to try and make a tool she could see herself using. To win the game, players match the Arabic word with the corresponding animal.

(For non-Arabic speakers: the animal's name is in the 'data-animal' attribute of the 'card-wrapper' div. You can cheat by using dev tools!)

3. Known issues

- Not at all mobile friendly nor responsive for different screen sizes.
- Styling could use a bit of work.

4. Possible future features

- A difficulty slider to set the size of the grid/# of cards
- A larger set of vocabulary (currently only 10 pairs are chosen randomly, but it is possible to add more animals)
- A drop-down menu for choosing other sets of vocabulary (not just animals)
